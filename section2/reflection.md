## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I tend to first try my best to find the answer myself. If I really need help, I will ask the question.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- It forced me to really research about it first which took time but I learned.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional statement in Javascript (If, Else If, Else) is really just like giving choices on how to proceed depending on the statement. For example, If a statement is true, then run the code. If it's not true, then do this instead.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- one can use the (if else) and (else) statements for more conditions. The use of logical operators and comparison operators to build the conditions will help the program decide which code to run, depending on whether the statement is true or false.
-
1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- probably try first how the code will display (for example: repl.it)

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- I will have to read about it more.
