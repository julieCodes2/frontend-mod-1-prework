## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I cannot accessed the article, unfortunately. The link is broken.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
Strings are letters and other characters wrapped within single or double quotation marks.
Boolean has two values: true or false.
Numbers data type handles all numbers like Integers(whole numbers) or floats(decimals).
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World");
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// for single line comments
/*
for more than one line
another line
another lines
*/
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a container that hold information but you can always change the name or label of the container.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Amazon
variables could be name, address, phone Numbers, items in wishlist or cart.
data types could then be strings, numbers, arrays.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is a programming term that joins data types together using the (+) operator. I can also type other characters that I want to be included in the code/statement/s.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
Amazon
When I order something, I automatically get a receipt with my name. It must be pre-programmed with the name of the current user added to it.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I do like interpolation better than concatenation. I just want to know more about when to use which.
