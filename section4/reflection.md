## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- It is better when I take breaks in between.
1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- yes. taking breaks helps.
1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
- An object is like an Array. An object holds data about a variable inside its key-value pairs.
- Array in Javascript is like a container for storing a list of many items in one variable. The keyword is Lists.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  -Array because this will be just a list of names
  * List of states and their capitals
  -Object because this a key-value pair.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  -Array because this is just a list of things to pack.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  -Array because this is just a list of names of all the Instagram accounts that I follow.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  -Object because this is a key-value pair.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  -Object because this is a key-value pair.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  -Array because this will be just a list of all the names of my favorite restaurants.


1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

- For example Amazon \
Key value-pairs: \
totalAmount = 100; \
items = 10; \
discount = 5; \

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- I honestly need to review this again before Mod 1 to really truly understand everything.
