## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- I can learn anything if I make an effort to learn it and not give up.
- It's ok to ask question and learn from other people.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- Applying to Turing demonstrated a Growth Mindset for me. I did not major in Computer Science or anything related, but I believe I will get the knowledge I need if I work hard for it.
- In which ways I do not demonstrate a Growth mindset? Probably when I doubt myself whenever I don't know the answer to a code problem yet.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Probably Amazon because there is a wishlist and the shopping cart which has a list of things I want to buy.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An array method is a way to store a list of values that are related to each other (for example: Shopping list), rather than listing the items separately, we can put the items in one, single array (for example: in one single piece of paper).

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- Loops is a method that instructs the computer to repeat a process until I tell it to end.
- I would use a loop with array if for example, I have an array and the task would be the same and is applicable to every values in the array.
- i would use a loop without array if I don't have an array and probably if I only have one single value in a variable.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- Loops is like telling the computer to repeat a task/process until i tell it to end.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I honestly need to read about these more before Mod 1.
